Don't bother trying to get this to run.  

Seamless support was actually removed after Windows XP--something I didn't know when I was working on when getting this to compile.  I did manage to get it to to run, but it was useless once I did.  

However, there are workarounds.  I managed to get seamless working between Windows 7 and CentOS 7, and documented the process [here](http://tech.poweredbyorphans.net/natively-run-windows-applications-on-linux-with-seamlessrdp-and-rdesktop/).


If you're just looking for the seamlessrdp binary, you can download a more modern version from Cendio.  It's in the ThinLinc Server bundle [(download link, valid email address required)](https://www.cendio.com/downloads/server/register.py) in the tl-version-server\windows-tools\wts-tools directory.
